# Open API - Open Application Programming Interface

<https://github.com/OAI/OpenAPI-Specification>

Open API is a standard format for metadata used to define RESTful services. It defines standard, programming-language-agnostic interface description for REST APIs.

Swagger is a toolset and a structured approach for creating API designs, documentation, and code throughout the API lifecycle.

Other tools can build SDKs based on the Open API specification, and the Swagger structured approach.

Swagger began in 2010 as an open source tooling AND specification to provide interactive API documentation and SDK.

In 2015 is was acquired by SmartBear, who donated the specification portion to the Open API Initiative, who renamed the swagger specification to the Open API Specification.

Members of the Open API Initiative include Microsoft, Google, IBM, Paypal, and SmartBear.

1. Editor: Create OpenAPI definitions
2. UI: Generate docs from API definitions
3. Codegen: Build client SDKs from API definitions

## Open API Interface

Exposes end-point or operations that clients can use to access API resources, via HTTP requests.

Some end-point might require the client to provide additional information with the request to properly invoke the operation.

Finally, API might send a response after certain requests.

The Open API Specification helps us document all the different implementation details involved in the API implementation, so that it can be understand by developers, while also being easy to programmatically consume.
