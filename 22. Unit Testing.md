# Unit test: a single object

- Thorough
- Stable
- Fast
- Few

Be _minimalist_, use _good judgment_, test _everything once_, test _interface_ not _implementation_, trust _collaborators_ will complete the side-effect, insist on _simplicity_

## Focus on messages

From an object/function point of view, messages can originate as:

1. Incoming messages
2. Outgoing messages
3. Internal Messages
   Messages types can be:
4. Query: return something, change nothing, no side-effects
5. Command: returns nothing, changes something, side-effect definition.
6. Mix: returns something, changes something, dangerous.

## How to test messages:

| Message  | Query                                                       | Command                                                  | Mix                                                            |
| -------- | ----------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Incoming | Assertion of the value (result/return):                     | Assertion of the value (direct/local public side-effect) | Assertion of the value (both return AND public side-effect).   |
| Internal | Ignore                                                      | Ignore                                                   | Ignore!                                                        |
| Outgoing | Ignore, someone else is already testing the incoming query. | Expect to send an outgoing command.                      | Ignore the Outgoing query, expect to send an Outgoing command. |

### Incoming

Test the interface, not the implementation, so the implementation can change keeping the interface the same (e.g.: bcryptjs and bcrypt, same interface, different implementation)

- _The receiver is the only place where you make assertions about values. Receiver of the incoming message has sole responsibility for asserting the result OR the direct public side-effect._

### Internal

Do not test private methods. Do not make assertions about their results. Do not set expectations/assertions to send them. Break rule if it saves $$$ during development

- _Break the rule if, for example, you have a complex private algorithm, and can't get it running unless you TDD it, these test are good early on, but lose value as time passes as other people are not willing to improve the private method so it doesn't break the test_

### Outgoing Queries

Do not test outgoing query messages. Do not make assertions about their results. Do not set expectations/assertions to send them.
If a message has no side-effects, it is invisible to your program, the sender should not test it.

- _The incoming query message of an object/function, is the outgoing query message of another object/function, so by testing the incoming query message, you already tested the outgoing query message._

### Outgoing Commands

- _Verify that you sent an outgoing command message. Do not test the side-effect, that the responsibility of the function that receives your message as incoming command. Your responsibility is to make sure the message is sent correctly, nothing else. If 3-4 functions down the line the side-effect broke down, that's not your problem, you sent the message correctly_
- _Break the rule if the side-effect is near-by, stable, and cheap to test._
