Java Runtime Environment (JRE) needed to run Java programs
Java Development Kit (JDK) needed to build and develop Java programs, includes the JRE.

All Java code is inside a class.

## Spring Definitions

1. POJO - Plain old Java object, true objects with state and behavior
2. Java Beans, simple objects with only getters and setters
3. Spring beans, POJOs configured in the application
4. DTO, Bean used to move state between layers

Inversion of Control in Spring
IoC Container: Mechanism for dependency injection
ApplicationContext: wraps the BeanFactory, which serves the beans to the runtime of the application
Spring Boot: provides auto-configuration of the ApplicationContext

## Spring Boot

- Supports rapid development
- Removes boilerplate of application setup
- Cloud native support, but also traditional

Key components:

- Embedded Tomcat
- Auto-config of ApplicationContext
- Automatic serlet mappings
- Embedded database support and hibernate/JPA dialect
- Automatic controller mappings
