# Clean Code Intro

`2020-01-29, clean code`

What is a class?
What is an interface?
What is an instance?
What is a method?
What is a property?
What is a variable?
What is an argument?
What is a variable?
Dependency Injection vs Dependency Inversion vs Inversion of Control.

Even bad code can function, but if code isn't clean, it can bring a development organization to its knees.
-Robert C. Martin

With functions we measure size by counting physical lines. With classes, we should measure by counting responsibilities.
-Robert C. Martin

• Readable
• Simple
• Straightforward
• Crystal Clear
• Unsurprising
• Readable
• Expresses its design ideas
• Minimal Dependencies

Naming:

1. Qualities:
   a. Meaningful
   b. Intention-revealing
   c. Pronounceable
   d. Large scope requires long names
   e. Use the same name for a concept consistently
2. Guidelines
   a. Methods: verbs
   i. Resume, Set, Get, etc
   ii. Small as possible
   iii. Do only one thing (single responsibility)
   iv. Avoid nested if-else-if
   b. Class Names: nouns
   i. Job, Work, Test, etc
   ii. Should be small (in terms of responsibilities)
   iii. Describe a class with 25 characters max
   iv. Don’t use words like if, and, or, but
   v. Describe the responsibility of the class
   vi. Its variables and utility methods should be private
   vii. No need to define setter/getter for everything
   viii. Order your code: Constant > Variables > Methods
   c. Properties: descriptive
   i. ID, Name, Version, isActive
   d. Variables: descriptive
   i. String: Name
   ii. Boolean: isActive
   iii. Number: ID, Version

Formatting:

1. Avoid long lines (80-120 chars)
2. Proper indent: 2 spaces (never tabs)
3. File should look like newspaper articles
   a. Headers, subtitles, blocks of ideas (paragraphs)
   b. You can glance at a newspaper and get all surface information easily, or dive into an article and get a succinct summary of the content
4. Affinity should produce nearness
   a. See code as thoughts, organize them so related thoughts are near each other
5. Order your code
   a. Constants
   b. Variables
   c. Methods
6. SOLID principle
   a. Single Responsibility: a class should have one responsibility, so if a lot of requirements change, a class is only affected by one change.
   b. Open/Closed principle: a module (class or method) should be open for extension, and closed for modification, so changes are implemented by extending, not modifying
   c. Liskov's Substitution Principle: objects are replaceable with instances of their subtypes, without altering the correctness of that program.
   d. Interface Segregation: clients should not depend on interfaces they do not use.
   e. Dependency Inversion: Program for interfaces, not implementation. (depend on abstraction, not implementation)
7. Always handle Errors
   a. Exceptions
   b. Try-Catch
   c. Handle errors and provide intent, context, error type, error name, error message
   d. Wrap third-party library APIs to remap their exceptions as needed
8. Unit tests:
   a. As clean as the code it's testing.
   b. Each test has a single concept.
   c. Test-Driven-Development (TDD)
   d. F.I.R.S.T. rule:
   i. Fast, Independent, Repeatable, Self-validating, Timely
   e. Good coverage
