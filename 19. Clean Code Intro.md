# Clean Code Intro

`2020-01-29, clean code`

What is a class?
What is an interface?
What is an instance?
What is a package?
What is a method?
What is a property?
What is a function?
What is a variable?
What is an argument?
Dependency Injection vs Dependency Inversion vs Inversion of Control.

Even bad code can function, but if code isn't clean, it can bring a development organization to its knees.
-Robert C. Martin

With functions we measure size by counting physical lines. With classes, we should measure by counting responsibilities.
-Robert C. Martin

Naming:

1. Qualities:
   a. Meaningful
   b. Intention-revealing
   c. Pronounceable
   d. Large scope requires long names
   e. Use the same name for a concept consistently
2. Guidelines
   a. Methods: verbs
   i. Resume, Set, Get, etc
   ii. Small as possible
   iii. Do only one thing (single responsibility)
   iv. Avoid nested if-else-if
   b. Class Names: nouns
   i. Job, Work, Test, etc
   ii. Should be small (in terms of responsibilities)
   iii. Describe a class with 25 characters max
   iv. Don’t use words like if, and, or, but
   v. Describe the responsibility of the class
   vi. Its variables and utility methods should be private
   vii. No need to define setter/getter for everything
   viii. Order your code: Constant > Variables > Methods
   c. Properties: descriptive
   i. ID, Name, Version, isActive
   d. Variables: descriptive
   i. String: Name
   ii. Boolean: isActive
   iii. Number: ID, Version

Formatting:

1. Avoid long lines (80-120 chars)
2. Proper indent: 2 spaces (never tabs)
3. File should look like newspaper articles\
   a. Headers, subtitles, blocks of ideas (paragraphs)\
   b. You can glance at a newspaper and get all surface information easily, or dive into an article and get a succinct summary of the content
4. Affinity should produce nearness\
   a. See code as thoughts, organize them so related thoughts are near each other
5. Order your code\
   a. Constants\
   b. Variables\
   c. Methods
6. SOLID principle\
   a. Single Responsibility: a class should have one responsibility, so if a lot of requirements change, a class is only affected by one change.\
   b. Open/Closed principle: a module (class or method) should be open for extension, and closed for modification, so changes are implemented by extending, not modifying\
   c. Liskov's Substitution Principle: objects are replaceable with instances of their subtypes, without altering the correctness of that program.\
   d. Interface Segregation: clients should not depend on interfaces they do not use.\
   e. Dependency Inversion: Program for interfaces, not implementation. (depend on abstraction, not implementation)
7. Always handle Errors\
   a. Exceptions\
   b. Try-Catch\
   c. Handle errors and provide intent, context, error type, error name, error message\
   d. Wrap third-party library APIs to remap their exceptions as needed
8. Unit tests:\
   a. As clean as the code it's testing.\
   b. Each test has a single concept.\
   c. Test-Driven-Development (TDD)\
   d. F.I.R.S.T. rule:\
   i. Fast, Independent, Repeatable, Self-validating, Timely\
   e. Good coverage

## Chapter One - Clean Code

- Code = Details of requirements = Specifications = Programming = Code
- _Later equals never_
- Bad code is the programmers fault, managers defend schedules and requirements with passion, we must defend good code with equal passion.
- _The only way to go fast, is to keep code clean at all times_

- _Clean code is elegant and efficient, makes it hard for bugs to hide, minimal dependencies, complete error handling, performance close to optimal._
- _Clean code looks like it was written by someone who cares, and there is nothing obvious to improve._

- No duplication, expressiveness, tiny abstractions.
- There is no way to write code without reading code, so making it easy to read makes it easier to write.

### Principles

- Single Responsibility = Only one reason to change
- Open Closed
- Dependency Inversion

## Chapter Two - Meaningful Names

_Clarity is king_
_Say what you mean, mean what you say._
_Code should be a quick skim, not intense study._

- Intention-Revealing Names
  - Why it exists
  - What it does
  - How it is used
- Avoid disinformation
  - Use descriptive names
  - Avoid ambiguity
- Meaningful Distinctions
  - ProductData and ProductInfo are the same, find better names
  - Variable name should never contain the word `variable`
  - Table name should never contain the word `table`
  - String name should never contain the word `string`
- Pronounceable names
- Searchable names
  - Single letter variables are very difficult to find, imagine search for the variable name `a` or `i`
  - _Length of the name should correspond the size of its scope_
- Avoid encodings, for example:
  - Hungarian notation
  - Member prefixes
- Avoid mental mapping
- Class Names = Noun, avoid verbs
- Method names = verbs, avoid nouns
  - Accessors `get`, mutators `set` and predicates `is` use these traditional prefixes
- Don't be cute, clarity over entertainment
- One word per concept
  - Avoid using `fetch`, `retrieve` and `get` in the same codebase
  - Same for `controller`, `manager`, `driver`
- Use Names from the client's Business Domain (Problem Domain and Solution Domain)
  - But don't turn your codebase into an accounting textbook
  - Use names from Computer Science, algorithms, patterns, math.
  - But again don't turn your codebase into an encyclopedia.
- Don't add unnecessary context

## Chapter Three - Functions

- _Duplication is the root of evil_
- Large function, and every block within a large function, should have one entry point and one exit, that means only one `return`, and no `break` or `continue` in loops.
- So it's okay for smaller functions to have multiple `return`, `break` or `continue`
- _You can't follow the rules from the start, you have to build long and complicated functions with lots of indenting and nested loops, arbitrary names, long argument lists, duplicated code. Then you refine the code, splitting functions, changing names, eliminating duplication, that's how you end up following all the rules_

### Rules of functions

1. Should be small.
2. Should be smaller than that.
3. Should be transparently obvious
4. **DO ONE THING, DO IT WELL, AND ONLY THAT.**
   1. That means one doing their stated function, doesn't mean literally one line of code.
   2. If you can extract another function with an unique name, then your function wasn't doing only one thing.
   3. Functions that do one thing cannot be reasonably subdivided
   4. Functions should either return information, or change the state of an object, but not both.
5. Should lead you to the next in a compelling order
6. Size:
   1. Should not be more than 150 characters long.
   2. Better is they are no more than 100-120.
   3. Should not be 100 lines long.
   4. Should hardly ever be more than 20 lines.
   5. Should not have more than 2 indent levels
7. Two arguments of less, preferably zero.
   1. One argument to ask a question `fileExists('myFile')`, calculate something `fileOpen('myFile')`, or act on an event `passwordFailed('attempts')`
      1. Use good verb/noun combinations like `write(name)` or `writeField(name)`
   2. Two arguments for Cartesian points `Point(0,0)`
   3. Three arguments should be refactored to two or less
8. Avoid side-effects
   1. Side effects are lies, hidden actions that you don't expect
   2. A function that checks for validPassword but also initializes the session if valid, that's an unexpected side-effect, because the name doesn't make that clear.
   3. And also violates "Do one thing"

These rules implies that blocks within `if`, `else`, and `while` statements should be one line long, probably a function call, so the whole block is below 20 lines.

`switch` statements are hard to make small, by definition they are meant to do _more than one_ thing, so avoid them, and when unavoidable, bury them in low-level class and never repeat it, we do this with polymorphism.

Code block should be read top to bottom, as sets of _**TO**_ paragraphs:

> TO build a car, we include the body, interior, car wheels, and engine
>
> > TO include the body, we include metals, soldering...\
> > TO include interior, we include electronics, seat...\
> > TO include car wheels, we include rubber, steel alloys...\
> > TO include engine, we include engine block, transmission...

### Chapter Four - Comments

- _Comments are compensating for our failure to express ourselves in code_

- Don't comment on bad code, clean it instead
- Explain yourself in code, not comments
- It is a pity when a comment doesn't explain itself clearly

## Chapter Five - Formatting

- Code formatting is about communication, and communication should be professional.
- Code end goal is not about "getting it working", it's about readability, maintainability, extensibility.

### Formatting rules

- Vertical size: smaller files are easier to understand, but there are no hard and fast rules.
  - _FitNesse has over 50,000 lines, but files average 200 lines, with upper limit of 500 lines_
  - Think of source code like it's a newspaper, it has many articles, some small, some large, and every article has a structure:
    - The headline tells you what the story is about, so you decide if you want to read more
    - First paragraph is a synopsis of the whole story and broad concepts
    - As you continue reading, you get more and more details: names, quotes, claims.
- Vertical openness: every line is an expression, and a group of lines form a complete thought, those thoughts could be separated with blank lines
- Related concepts should be close together, vertical distance between two concepts is an indicator of how related they are.
- Declare variables as close to their usage as possible
- Vertical Ordering: function call dependencies should point downwards
- Indentation = hierarchy = scope
- Formatting rules are a team effort

## Chapter Six - Objects and Data structure

_Mature programmers know that the idea of everything is an object is **a myth**. Sometimes you really do want simple data structures with procedures operating on them_

Objects expose behavior and hide data, making it easy to add more objects easily, but harder to add new functions.
Data structures expose data and have no functions, making it easy to new functions, but hard to add new data structures to existing functions

## Chapter Seven - Error Handling

Try to write tests that force exceptions, and then add behavior to your handler to satisfy your tests. This will cause you to build the transaction scope of the try block first and will help you maintain the transaction nature of that scope.

Special Case Pattern: handle errors as early as possible, configure objects to handle special cases for you, for example:

```
Get an employee meal expense for the day
Add meal expense to company expense
If expense is null, step 2 throws and error
   Handle error
```

You should configure the employee meal expense to return `0` instead of `null`, that way you don't have to handle that null as an error later

Another example:

```
Get list for all employees
If list is not null
   Loop through list and calculate pay
```

You should configure the employees list to return an empty list, then you don't have to check for null because looping an empty list is no problem.
