Hook: react function that lets you hook into react state and lifecycle features from inside a function component

Array destructuring allows us to give different names to the state variables when declaring `useState` one or more times. React assumes you will always call hooks in the same order, that's why you can call hooks multiple times with different variables.

## Hooks

- 📌State Hook, `useState` = add and manage local component state
  - You can use primitive values as the initial value, or arrays, or objects
  - Its recommended to simply split state into multiple `useStates`, and only use arrays or objects for variables that always change together
  - `setState` always replaces the whole state, it doesn't merge it, keep that in mind when you set and array or object as initial value
  - You can provide a variable as argument to `setState` like this: `setState(var)` and that will replace state
  - You can also provide a function to `setState`, that function will receive the previous state as argument, and anything returned from it will be the new state
    - This is useful when you have a calculation that depends on previous state, because `setState` is async and simply queueing multiple `setState` calls leads to react ignoring most of them since they are applying the same value
    - For example: with `const counter = 1`, sending `setState(counter + 1)` three times ends up with react seeing three `setState(1 + 1)`, that means it will apply the first and ignore the rest, ending up with `counter = 2`
    - Instead you should send three `setState(oldCounter => oldCounter + 1)`, that way react will execute the function three times, and you end up with `counter = 4`. Note that `oldCounter` can be anything, like `banana`, but `oldCounter` is more semantically correct.
- ⚡️Effect Hook, `useEffect` = execute side-effects from inside a component after rendering the component, by default on every render, including the first render.
  - Side-effects can either require clean-up or not
    - Without clean-up, run and forget: Network requests, manual DOM mutations, logging
    - With clean-up, to avoid memory leaks: subscription to external data source or setInterval, you then declare a return function inside the effect, and react will use it to cleanup the side-effect
  - Can have an optional second argument, an array of one or more values to check, if no values changed, `useEffect` doesn't run on that re-render
    - If using this second argument, make sure to check all variables used by the effect that you might need to include
  - Try to declare functions used by `useEffect` _inside_ `useEffect` (using an anonymous arrow function), to easily see what variables `useEffect` is using
- 🔌Context Hook, `useContext` = read and subscribe component to contexts
  - Used to share states with different components without having to pass down a props through multiple components
  - Can be used to share states from `useState` and `useReducer`
- 🔌Reducer Hook, `useReducer` = one source of truth for multiple States, dispatchers, actions (simplified Redux built-into react), used to manage complex local state, alternative to `useState`
  - `useState` hook is built using `useReducer`, so `useReducer` is a more primitive `useState`
  - You can implement `useReducer` with two arguments `useReducer(reducer, initialState)` or with three `useReducer(reducer, initialArgument, init)`
    - Two arguments simply sets the state to `initialState`
    - With three arguments, the `initialArgument` has to go through the `init` function, and whatever `init` returns is then set as state
      - So if your `initialArgument` is `2` and `init` is `return initial + 2` then the state will be `4`
      - This is useful when your `initialArgument` is `props`, and you want to do some calculations to get the proper state value out of the `props`.
    - After choosing to use 2 or 3 arguments, you then need to declare the `reducer` function and the `init` function is you chose 3 arguments
    - Your `reducer` and `init` functions can be anything and return anything, but the convention is for `reducer` to contain a `switch case`, and always send an object that contains at least the property `type`, so `{ type: 'ACTION' }`, as that will be used for the `switch case` logic, but can have many more properties to perform complex actions inside the `reducer` function
    - So basically `useReducer` helps avoids having multiple `setState`s in different functions by putting all the states in one place/object, and modifying those states based on the action object (`type: 'ACTION'`) you send via `dispatch`
  - Basic `useReducer` signature: `const [state, dispatch] = useReducer(reducer, initialArgument, init)`
  - Basic `reducer` signature: `const reducer = (state, action) => { switch(action.type) { case/return state case/return state default/new Error() }}`
  - Basic `dispatch` call: `onClick={() => dispatch({ type: 'ACTION', modifier1: '10', modifier-n: 'N' })}`
  - `state` is equals to `initialArgument` if you omit `init`, otherwise `state` is equals to whatever `init` returns.
  - If you specify an `init` function, it will be called on the first render, and the return will be set as the component's state
    - Reducer = takes the `state` and an `action` and returns the updated `state`, this then triggers a re-render the application similar to how `useState` and `setState` work
    - Dispatcher = we call the `dispatch` with an action object, that contains at least one property `type`, so `{ type: 'INCREMENT' }`
      - React guarantees that `dispatch` function identity is stable and won’t change on re-renders, so you can pass it down with props or context
    - Action = is an object that contains at least the `type` property, it will dictate the behavior of the `reducer` function
    - Store = is when you use an object for the `state` to hold multiple states
      - Don't be afraid to use multiple `useReducer`s to handle multiple `state` objects, because if you pull all your state in one object, every single property change will trigger a re-render of every component using that massive state
      - Instead make separate state objects for properties that update together, for example, if your state object has `mouseX, mouseY, isUserValid`, every time the mouse moves you will re-render all the components that depend on `isUserValid`. It would be better to make a separate object for `mouseX, mouseY` so the value of `isUserValid` only changes when necessary
      - You can even reuse the `reducer` function in multiple `useReducer` calls, since `reducer` works with any state you send with any of the multiple `dispatch`ers

| Are state transitions related?       | Not necessarily, multiple useStates can simply be separate entities     | Can group related state into one state object and manipulate the whole object with useReducer                        |

| Local or global state?               | Local, because you don't want to deal with passing multiple `setState`s | Global + useContext, because you can pass one `dispatch` that triggers a complex reducer with multiple manipulations |

- `useRef` = ?
- 💡 Custom hooks: always start with use, and are used to extract hook logic into its own function and reuse it in multiple components
  - So you can move the `useState` initialization, the handleChange functions, any `useEffect` initialization related, into its own custom use function, and then call that custom Hook from inside the original React function component
  - Each call to a custom Hook has a completely isolated state, so you can reuse the same custom Hook multiple times inside one React component

## Rules of Hooks

- Always call Hooks at top level, do not call them inside a conditions, loops, nested functions, etc.
  - This is because React relies on Hook order to maintain state, so hiding a Hook inside a condition can change the order and lead to bugs
- Always call Hooks from React function component, do not call them from regular javascript functions
  - The only exception is if you're making a custom Hook

## Why Hooks

- No need to use the `this` keyword, lowering the entry knowledge barrier
  - No need to bind event handlers like in class components
- Functional components with hooks minify better than Class components
- Provide a logical way to reuse stateful components, there was no particular way to do this with Class component
  - HOC and render props patterns were used to address this problem, but made code harder to follow
- Allow to organize related code closer together
  - For example, data fetching was usually scattered in `componentDidMount` and `componentDidUpdate` inside class components
  - Event listeners were also scattered in `componentDidMount` and `componentWillUnmount` in class components
  - Not only was related code scattered, but also unrelated code was put together
  - For example, data fetching and event listener code could be found in `componentDidMount`
