Course is based on [Mastery Learning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mastery_learning), where it's recommended to have _90%_ mastery on one subject before moving to the next.

Do **all** exercises not marked with an asterisk(\*), they are meant to help you reach mastery. Exercises marked with asterisk(\*) are only needed for the final grade/credits.

[Submission system](https://studies.cs.helsinki.fi/stats/courses/fullstackopen) can be used to submit exercises and get the course certificate.
Exercises are busmitted by uploading to github, linking to submission system, and marking them as done in the submission system.
Use sensible names for the repository folders, to clearly identify each part.
Exercises must be submitted **one part a a time**, and once submitted, you can no longer submit any more exercises for that part.
